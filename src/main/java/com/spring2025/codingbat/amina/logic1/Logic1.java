     Task 1 – cigarParty

     When squirrels get together for a party, they like to have cigars.
     A squirrel party is successful when the number of cigars is between 40 and 60, inclusive.
     Unless it is the weekend — then there is no upper bound on the number of cigars.

     cigarParty(30, false) → false
     cigarParty(50, false) → true
     cigarParty(70, true) → true
